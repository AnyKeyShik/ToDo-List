This is a proof-of-concept of BRC (Bum's Replace Cipher) simple substitution cipher.

# Getting started

#### Requirements

To compile and run this project, you will need:
* GNU G++ compiler
* Qt (>5.3)
* qMake
* GNU make

#### Running the code

Simply use the following commands in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnyKeyShik/ToDo-List.git
cd ToDo-List
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make
```

# The main idea
The main idea of this cipher is replace the original letter to random symbols separated by some delimiter. Delimiter is calculated based on numebr of letters in non-encrypted text. It's only a raw idea and maybe we improve this cipher in the future
